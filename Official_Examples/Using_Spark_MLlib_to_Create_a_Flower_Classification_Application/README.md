# Using Spark MLlib to Predict Iris Flower Classification

IRIS, also known as Iris flower dataset, is a multivariate analysis dataset. A dataset contains 150 datasets, which are divided into three types. Each type contains 50 data and each data contains four attributes. It can be used to predict which of the three species (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) the iris belongs to by four attributes: calyx length, calyx width, petal length, and petal width.

This example describes how to use the Spark MLlib engine to implement iris classification prediction. The following figure shows the operation process of the Iris Flower Classification Prediction sample. The example is demonstrated on Flexible Engine, a public cloud solution proposed by Orange Business for Service.

1.  **[Prepare Data](#section055233642011)**： Prepare Dataset and upload demo code to Flexible Engine OBS service
2.  **[Train Model](#section15883611781)**：Based on Spark Mlib ALS Algo, The code is for training the model
3.  **[Deploy Model](#section7124946131216)**：Once we get the model, we will deploy it online on ModelArts Inference service in Paris region
4.  **[Predict Result](#section773012861716)**：Test if the inference works well
